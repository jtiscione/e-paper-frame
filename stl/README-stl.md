These are STL files for a picture frame case that fits the
Waveshare Pico 5.65 inch 7-color ACeP e-Paper display.

The back has 4 holes for mounting to the device with M2.5 screws.
In addition it has 4 holes for attaching M3 screws to the front.
The holes in the front are wide enough to accomodate M3 threaded inserts,
which are needed for assembly along with the M3 and M2.5 screws.

The holes on the side are for accessing the three user-programmable buttons on the board.
