These are STL files for a picture frame case that fits the Waveshare Pico 5.65 inch 7-color ACeP e-Paper display.

- `565_inch_picture_frame_front.stl` is the front part. It has 4 holes wide enough to accomodate M3 brass threaded inserts.
It also has three holes on the side for accessing the three user-programmable buttons that WaveShare included on the board.
- `565_inch_picture_frame_back.stl` is the back part with 4 holes for attaching M3 screws to the front.
It also has 4 holes for M2.5 screws which fit into the spacers that WaveShare supplies.

So assembly requires four M3 screws, four M2.5 screws, and four M3 brass threaded inserts (inserted into the plastic with a soldering iron).
