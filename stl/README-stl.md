These are STL files for a picture frame case that fits the Waveshare Pico 5.65 inch 7-color ACeP e-Paper display.

Assembly requires four M2.5 screws, four M3 screws, and four M3 brass threaded inserts (inserted into the plastic with a soldering iron).

- `565_inch_picture_frame_front.stl` is the front part. It has 4 holes wide enough to accomodate M3 brass threaded inserts.
It also has three holes on the side for accessing the three user-programmable buttons that WaveShare included on the board.

- `565_inch_picture_frame_back.stl` is the back part with 4 holes for attaching M3 screws to the front.
It also has 4 holes for M2.5 screws which fit into Waveshare's brass spacers underneath.
Just like the app, it supports both landscape and portrait mode; you can hang it on the wall either way.
